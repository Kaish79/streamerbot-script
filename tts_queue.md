## Description
Put TTS messages into a queue and have it play one by one whenever you want. You can skip messages, listen to the previous one again and you can remove all messages of a user from the remaining queue. You can even post the message to your Discord and have it linked your current VOD with a timestamp. It also comes with helpers for your own OBS overlay.

{: .new }
To use an OBS overlay, you can create your own text sources. One text source for the queue count `42/100` and one for the time `00:42:13`. You can then paste the names into the settings menu and it will automatically update whenever the queue count changes.

## Commands

- ## `!AUCTION`

  Gives information about the currently active auction (like the redeemer's own bid, the highest bid, etc).

{: .new }
You can essentially use any trigger you want for reading a new message, reading a previous one, skipping, clearing etc. Just the triggers that add to the queue are final. If you think a different trigger is required, feel free to suggest it and I will see what I can do :)
